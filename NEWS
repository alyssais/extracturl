		- 1.5 released
		- Fixed undefined variable errors when used without URI::Find
		- Can toggle between showing the context of URLs in the main list and
		  showing the URLs themselves.
		- Can specify whether to show the list of URLs at first (default) or to
		  show the list of URL contexts

		- 1.4.1 released
		- Better contextual text handling (uses word boundaries instead of
		  explicit string lengths).
		- Pulls URLs out of HTML text AS WELL as HTML tags (silly, but
		  sometimes necessary). This text handling is not especially detailed,
		  and so may be somewhat sensitive to formatting issues (unexpected
		  line breaks, etc).

		- 1.4 released
		- Added support for a configurable alternative selection key (via
		  ALTSELECT), allowing a person to, in effect, temporarily negate the
		  PERSISTENT setting.
		- Added conditional support for long options, if Getopt::Long is
		  available.

		- 1.3.3 released
		- Sometimes, multipart/alternative parts don't actually have an
		  alternative, which could fool this script. Now they're handled
		  correctly (normal text/plain have 0 parts, according to the MIME
		  parser).

2008-06-09 Kyle Wheeler <kyle@memoryhole.net>

		- 1.3.2 released
		- Discovered some really strange-looking emails (possibly with broken
		  UTF-8 encoding) that interfere with maintaining context information
		  for each URL. Added a workaround so that the script doesn't error out
		  (there just might not be any context for some URLs in those
		  messages).
